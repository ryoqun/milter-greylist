.SH NAME
.B greylist.conf
- milter-greylist configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B greylist.conf 
configures 
.B milter-greylist(8)
operation. The format is simple: each line contains a keyword and 
optional arguments. Any line starting with a # is considered as a comment
and is ignored. Blank lines are ignored as well. Comments at the end of
lines are accepted in some situations, but do not take them as granted.
A statement can be continued on the next line by using a backslash. Anything
after the backslash will be ignored.
.SH WHITELIST
The primary use of 
.B greylist.conf
is to setup 
.B milter-greylist(8)
whitelist. It also offers a handy blacklist feature. 
Access-lists (ACL) are used to do that. ACL enable the administrator 
to specify complex conditions on sender IP, sender DNS address,
sender e-mail address, and recipient e-mail address. If support for
DNSRBL was built-in, it is even possible to use DNSRBL in ACL.
.PP
An access-list entry starts with the
.I racl
keyword followed by an optional id quoted string, then the
.I greylist\fR,
.I whitelist\fR,
or
.I blacklist
keyword, and by any set of the following clauses: 
.I addr\fR,
.I domain\fR,
.I from\fR,
.I rcpt\fR,
.I rcptcount\fR,
.I helo\fR,
.I sm_macro\fR,
.I time\fR,
.I auth\fR,
.I tls\fR,
.I spf\fR
(if build with SPF support),
.I geoip\fR
(if build with GeoIP support),
.I p0f\fR
(if build with p0f support),
.I ldapcheck\fR
(if build with --with-openldap),
.I urlcheck\fR
(if built with --with-libcurl), and 
.I dnsrbl\fR
(if built with --enable-dnsrbl).
A message will match an ACL entry when it complies with all of its clauses.
.PP
Clauses can be negated, by prefixing them by the
.I not
keyword.
.TP
.I addr
This clause is used to specify a netblock of source IP 
addresses. The syntax is an IP address followed by a slash and a CIDR
netmask. Here is an example:
.IP
  racl whitelist addr 127.0.0.0/8
  racl whitelist addr 192.168.3.0/24
  racl whitelist addr ::1
.IP
If the netmask is ommitted, /32 is assumed for an IPv4 address and
/128 is assumed for an IPv6 address.
.IP
You should at least whitelist localhost (127.0.0.1/8), and if you have
some user clients connecting to the machine, you should whitelist the
addresses they connect from if you don't want them to get error 
messages when sending e-mail.
.TP
.I domain
This clause selects source machines based on their DNS name, performing 
a suffix search.
For instance, this will whitelist any machine in the 
.I example.net
domain:
.IP
  racl whitelist domain example.net
.IP
Suffix search matching  means, for example, that gle.com will match 
google.com. If you want domain names to match on subdomain boundaries 
(e.g.  gle.com will match mail.gle.com and gle.com but not google.com) 
then enable 
.I domainexact
.PP
The name resolution is made by Sendmail, which hands it to 
.B milter-greylist(8)\fR.
As a result, it is impossible to use DNS aliases here. On the other
hand, this will work even if your DNS resolver is not thread-safe.
.TP
.I from
This is used to select sender e-mail addresses. You should not use
that feature, because sender e-mail addresses can be trivially forged.
Example:
.IP
  racl whitelist from postmaster@example.com
.TP
.I rcpt
This is used to select recipient addresses. Example:
.IP
  racl greylist rcpt John.Doe@example.net
.TP
.I rcptcount
Followed by an operator and a recipient count, this is used to select the
amount of recipients. Example:
.IP
  racl blacklist rcptcount >= 25 msg "No more than 25 recipients, please"
.TP
.I helo
Followed by a quoted string or a regular expression, this can be used to
filter on the HELO string.
.TP
.I sm_macro 
This is used to select a Sendmail macro value. See the section on that
topic for more information.
.TP
.I time
This is used to specify a time set. It should be followed by a quoted string
of 
.B crontab(5)\fR-like
time specification. Here is an example that whitelists mail addressed to a 
single recipient during office hours (from 8:00 to 16:59 from monday to friday):
.IP
  racl whitelist time "* 8-16 * * 1-5" rcpt info@example.net
.TP
.I geoip
This is used to specify a country, as reported by GeoIP. The country code
must be upper case, and is only available if 
.B milter-greylist
was built with GeoIP support. The 
.I geoipdb 
statement can be used to specify the location of GeoIP database. 
.TP
.I p0f
This is used to match against the remote system OS fingerprint genre and
detail,obtained from p0f. It is only available if 
.B milter-greylist
was built with p0f support. 
.I p0f
clauses can be used with a quoted string for case-insensitive substring
match, or against regular expressions. The
.I p0fsock
statement can be used to speficy the location of the p0f socket.
.TP
.I auth
This is used to select a user that succeeded SMTP AUTH. In order to select
any user that succeeds SMTP AUTH, you can use a regular expression matching,
like below;
.IP
  racl whitelist auth /.*/
.IP
Using such a clause automatically disable global STARTTLS and
SMTP AUTH whitelisting, like if the
.I noauth
keyword would have been used.
.TP
.I tls
This is used to select the distinguished name (DN) of a user that succeeded
STARTTLS. Using such a clause automatically disable global STARTTLS and
SMTP AUTH whitelisting, like if the 
.I noauth
keyword would have been used.
.TP
.I spf
This is used to test SPF status. Possible values are 
.I pass\fR,
.I softfail\fR,
.I fail\fR,
.I unknown\fR,
.I error\fR,
.I none\fR,
and
.I self\fR.
The first six values are plain SPF validation status. The 
.I self
value is a special test that checks the server's local IP address against the
sender's SPF record. If that test validates, odds are good that the sender
SPF record is wide open, and this is hint that SPF should not be trusted.
.IP 
Absence of any value after the 
.I spf
keyword is a synonym for 
.I spf pass\fR. 
This is present for backward compatibility.
.IP
The
.I spf
clause
is only available if SPF support was compiled in. Using it will disable
global SPF whitelisting, like if the
.I nospf
keyword would have been used.
.TP
.I ldapcheck
This is used to query an LDAP directory.
See the section on that topic for more information.
.TP
.I urlcheck
This is used to query an external configuration source through an URL.
See the section on that topic for more information.
.TP
.I dnsrbl
This is used to select a DNSRBL. See the section on that topic for
more information.
.PP
The
.I domain\fR,
.I from\fR,
and
.I rcpt
clauses may be used with regular expressions. The regular expressions must be
enclosed by slashes (/). No escaping is available to provide a slash
inside a regular expression, so just do not use it. Regular expressions
follow the format described in 
.B re_format(7)\fR.
Here is an example:
.PP
  racl greylist rcpt /.*@example\\.net/
.PP
When regular expressions are not used,
.I from\fR,
and
.I rcpt
perform a case insensitive substring match with leading and trailing
brackets, spaces and tabs stripped out. 
.I domain
performs a case insensitive suffix match.  This means, for example, 
that gle.com will match google.com. If you want domain names to match 
on subdomain boundaries (e.g.  gle.com will match mail.gle.com and 
gle.com but not google.com) then enable 
.I domainexact
.PP
An ACL entry can also hold various optional parameter used on match: 
.I delay\fR,
.I autowhite\fR,
.I flushaddr\fR,
.I nolog\fR,
.I code\fR,
.I ecode\fR,
.I report\fR,
.I addheader\fR,
and
.I msg\fR
.TP
.I delay
Specify the greylisting delay used before the message can be accepted.
This overrides the 
.I greylist
global setting, and it only  makes sense on an 
.I racl greylist
entry. 
.TP
.I autowhite
Specify the autowhitelisting duration for messages matching this ACL.
This overrides the
.I autowhite
global setting, and it only makes sense on an
.I racl greylist
entry. Example:
.IP
  racl greylist rcpt JDoe@example.net delay 15m autowhite 3d
  racl greylist rcpt root@example.net delay 1h autowhite 3d
.TP
.I flushaddr
If a message matches the rule, any entry in the greylist or autowhite
databases matching the sender IP is removed. Used with a DNSRBL blacklist
ACL, it is useful for freeing the database from entries set up by a 
machine which is known to be a spamer. Example:
.IP
  racl blacklist dnsrbl "known-spamers" flushaddr
.TP
.I nolog
Do not generate syslog message if this rule matches. Example:
.IP
  racl whitelist default nolog
.TP
.I code
.TP
.I ecode
.TP
.I msg
These 3 values can be used to choose the SMTP code, extended code and
reply message for temporary failures and rejects. Example:
.IP
  racl blacklist dnsrbl "spamstomp" msg "IP caught by spamstomp"
  racl greylist default code "451" ecode "4.7.1"
.IP
The 
.I msg
strings accepts format string substitution as documented in the 
.B FORMAT STRINGS 
section. For instance,
.I %A
gets substituted by the ACL line number.
.IP
None of the last 3 values makes sense for a whitelist entry. 
.TP
.I report
This value overrides the text displayed in the
.I X-Greylist 
header, for messages that 
.B milter-greylist(8)
lets pass through, either because they are whitelisted, or because they
passed greylisting (see 
.B REPORTING\fR).
This string can be substituted as documented in the
.B FORMAT STRINGS
section.
.TP
.I addheader
This quoted string is a RFC822 header that gets added to the message. 
Format string substitution is supported. No check is done for header
length standard compliance, so make sure the substituted string is
shorter than 2048 characters.
.PP
Entries in the access-list are evaluated sequentially, so order is
very important. The first matching entry is used to decide if 
a message will be whitelisted or greylisted. A special
.I default
clause can be used in the last ACL entry as a wildcard. 
Here are a few complete ACL examples:
.PP
Example 1:
.nf

racl whitelist from friend@toto.com rcpt grandma@example.com
racl whitelist from other.friend@example.net rcpt grandma@example.com
racl greylist rcpt grandma@example.com
racl whitelist default
.fi
.PP
Example 2:
.nf

racl whitelist addr 193.54.0.0/16 domain friendly.com
racl greylist rcpt user1@atmine.com
racl greylist rcpt user2@atmine.com
racl greylist rcpt user3@atmine.com
racl whitelist default
.fi
.PP
Example 3:
.nf

racl whitelist rcpt /.*@.*otherdomain\\.org/
racl whitelist addr 192.168.42.0/24 rcpt user1@mydomain.org
racl whitelist from friend@example.net rcpt /.*@.*mydomain\\.org/
racl whitelist rcpt user2@mydomain.org
racl greylist rcpt /.*@.*mydomain\\.org/
racl whitelist default
.fi
.SH DATA-STAGE ACL
ACL using the
.I racl
keyword are evaluated at the RCPT stage of the SMTP transaction. It is 
also possible to have ACL evaluated at the DATA stage of the SMTP transaction,
using the 
.I dacl 
keyword, provided the message went through RCPT-stage ACL, and possibly
greylisting. Note that you canot use the
.I greylist
action at DATA-stage if the RCPT-stage ACL that matched had a 
.I greylist
action itself. The following
clauses can be used to work on message content:
.TP
.I dkim
DKIM status (if build with DKIM support). Possible values are 
.I pass\fR,
.I fail\fR,
.I unknown\fR,
.I error\fR,
and
.I none\fR,
.TP
.I header
String or regular expression searched in message headers
.TP
.I body
String or regular expression searched in message body
.TP
.I msgsize
Operator followed by a message size (k or M suffix allowed for kilobytes
or megabytes). Example:
.IP
  dacl blacklist msgsize >= 4M msg "No more than 4 MB please"
.TP
.I spamd
SpamAssassin score (if build with SpamAssassin support). If used without
comparison operator
.I spamd
is true if the score is above threshold. The
.I spamdsock
keyword can be used to specify the location of the spamd socket.
.IP
Example 1:
.nf

  spamdsock unix "/var/spamassassin/spamd.sock"
  racl whitelist default 
  dacl greylist spamd
.fi
.IP
Example 2:
.nf

  spamdsock inet "127.0.0.1:783"
  racl whitelist default 
  dacl blacklist spamd > 15 msg "Your message is considered spam."
  dacl greylist  spamd > 10 delay 2h
  dacl greylist  spamd > 5  delay 1h
.fi
.PP
Note that if there are multiple recipient, a
.I rcpt
clause at DATA stage evalutes to true if it matches any of them.
If you want to match an exact set of recipients, you can use multiple 
.I rcpt
clauses along with a
.I rcptcount
clause.
.PP
.SH LISTS
It is often useful to group several users or sender IP addresses in a single
ACL. This can be done with lists. Lists must be first defined and given 
a name before they can be used in ACL entries. Here is an example:
.IP
  list "my users" rcpt { user1@example.com user2@example.com }
  list "local" addr { 192.0.2.0/24 10.0.0.0/8 }

  racl whitelist list "local"
  racl greylist list "my users"
  racl whitelist default

.SH BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
Previous versions of 
.B milter-greylist(8)
used 
.I addr\fR,
.I domain\fR,
.I from\fR,
and
.I rcpt
lines, without the
.I racl
keyword.
Access-list management is intended to replace them.
These lines are still accepted by
.B milter-greylist(8)\fR,
but they are deprecated.
.B milter-greylist(8)
handles them as access-list entries with a single clause. They are added 
at the head of the access-list so the use of these keywords and 
access-lists may lead to unspecified behaviour. Do not mix them.
.PP
test mode (using
.B -T\fR)
is also deprecated. Access-list semantics do not depend on this flag.
.PP 
.B milter-greylist(8)
also used to only have a RCPT-stage ACL, which was configured through
.I acl
statements. These have been replaced by
.I racl
statements (as opposed to
.I dacl
statements for DATA-stage ACL). 
.I acl
statements are still accepted for backward compatibility and are a 
synonym for
.I racl
statements.
.SH MX SYNC
Synchronization of the greylist among multiple MX is configured using the 
.I peer 
keyword. List each other MX IP addresses using the 
.I peer 
keyword. Here is
an example:
.PP
  peer 192.0.2.18
  peer 192.0.2.17
.PP
You can list the local machine in the peer statements, it will be ignored.
.PP
By default, milter-greylist will listen on all interfaces using TCP port
5252 or the port number given by service named mxglsync if defined in 
.I /etc/services
or other directory service. This behaviour can be changed by using the
.I syncaddr
keyword. Here are a few examples:
.PP
  syncaddr *
  syncaddr * port 7689
  syncaddr 192.0.2.2 port 9785
  syncaddr 2001:db8::1:c3b5:123
  syncaddr 2001:db8::1:c3b5:123 port 1234
.PP
Using '*' as the address means to bind to all local interfaces' addresses.
Note that if you are not using the default port, all MXs must use the same 
port number. 
.PP
For outbound connections the system is selecting one of the possible adresses.
If you want to use a specific ip you can use:
.PP
  syncsrcaddr 123.456.78.9
.PP
.SH TEXT DUMP
.B milter-greylist(8)
uses a text dump of its database to resume operation after a crash. The dump
is performed at regular time interval, but as it is a heavy operation,
you might want to configure a particular time interval, using the
.I dumpfreq
option. 
.PP
If the
.I dumpfreq
value is too small, it will kill performance. If it is too high,
you will loose a bigger part of the database on a crash. 
.PP
Set 
.I dumpfreq
to 0 to get a dump on each change (kills performance),
Set it to -1 to never dump to a file (unsafe as you lose the whole 
greylist on each crash), or give a time value for the delay between dumps.
The time is given in seconds, except if a unit is given: m for minutes,
h for hours, and d for days.
.PP
You may further improve the performance of the dump operation at the expense
of humanly readable timestamp which by default appears as a comment at 
the end of each line in the dumpfile. You may disable generation of
this comment by specifying
.I dump_no_time_translation
option in the configuration file. This is specifficaly recommended if
your dumpfile grows to 100's of megabytes - it can reduce the time
needed for the dump operation by the order of magnitude!
.SH REPORTING
By default,
.B milter-greylist(8)
will add a 
.I X-Greylist
header to any message it handles. The header shows what happened to the
message: delayed or not delayed, and why. The following options can be
used in
.B greylist.conf
to alter this behavior:
.TP
.I report none
Never add a 
.I X-Greylist
header.
.TP
.I report delays
Only add a header if the message was delayed.
.TP
.I report nodelays
Add a header if the message was not delayed. The header explains why 
the message was not delayed.
.TP
.I report all
Always add a header. This is the default.
.SH SENDER CALLBACK SYSTEMS
Sender callback systems are another anti-spam measure that attempts to
send a DSN to the sender address before accepting a message. If that
fails, then the sender address is wrong and the message is rejected. 
Such systems usually stop their callback check at the RCPT stage of 
the SMTP transaction. 
.PP
Greylisting temporarily rejects at the RCPT stage, so sender callback
and greylisting love to fight each other.
.B milter-greylist(8)
proposes a workaround to that problem with the 
.I delayedreject
option. For messages coming from <> (that is, for DSN), it will cause 
the temporary reject to happen at the DATA stage of the SMTP transaction 
instead of the RCPT stage. That way,
.B milter-greylist(8)
will cope much better with sender callback systems. 
.PP
This has a minor drawback (and this is why it is not enabled by default): 
for a multi recipient DSN, whitelisted recipient will not be honoured: 
the message will be delayed for everyone. 
.SH SENDMAIL MACROS
Any sendmail macro can be used as a clause in the access list. You need to 
define a (macro, value) pair using the 
.I sm_macro
keyword before using it.  Here is an example that uses the 
.I {client_resolve}
macro to apply a larger greylisting delay to hosts that have a bogus 
reverse DNS:
.IP
  sm_macro "maybe_forged" "{client_resolve}" "FORGED"

  racl greylist sm_macro "maybe_forged" delay 1h
  racl greylist default delay 15m
.PP
A regular expression can be used as the macro value. 
It must be surrounded with slashes and not by quotes.
The special value 
.I unset
can also be used to match an unset macro:
.IP
  sm_macro "not_foo" "{foo}" unset
.PP
Note that any Sendmail macro that is not exported using the
.I Milter.macros.envrcpt 
setting of 
.I sendmail.cf
will be seen as unset from milter-greylist.
.SH DNSRBL
DNS Reverse Black List can be used to toggle an ACL. They must be defined
and named before they can be used. Here is an example which uses 
a bigger greylisting delay for hosts caught in the SORBS dynamic pool 
DNRSBL (this will include DSL and cable customers pools, which are well 
known to be massively infected by spamwares):
.IP
  dnsrbl "SORBS DUN" dnsbl.sorbs.net 127.0.0.10/32

  racl greylist dnsrbl "SORBS DUN" delay 1h
  racl greylist default delay 15m
.PP
The definition of a DNSRBL starts by the
.I dnsrbl
keyword, followed by the quoted name of the DNSRBL, the DNS domain on 
which addresses should be looked up, and the answer we should consider
as a positive hit.
.PP
DNSRBL support is only available if enabled through the --enable-dnsrbl
config flag. Please make sure
.B milter-greylist(8)
is linked against a thread-safe DNS resolver, otherwise it shall crash.
.SH URL checks
.B milter-greylist(8) 
is able to query external sources of information 
through various URL, if it was built with --with-libcurl. Here is an 
example:
.IP
  urlcheck "glusr" "http://www.example.net/mgl-config?rcpt=%r" 5

  racl greylist urlcheck "glusr" delay 15m 
  racl whitelist default
.PP
The trailing 5 at the end of the
.I urlcheck
definition is the maximum number of simultaneous connections we want to 
launch on this URL. For each message, the URL will be querried, with  % format 
tags being subtituted. For instance,
.I %r
is substituted by the recipient. See the 
.B FORMAT STRINGS
section for the complete list of substitutions.
.PP
.B milter-greylist(8) 
expects an answer containing a list of \\n terminated lines, with  
.I key: value 
pairs. The most basic answer to get a match is:
.IP
  milterGreylistStatus: Ok
.PP
.I TRUE 
can be used as an alias for
.I Ok
here. 
.PP
The answer can be more complex, with keys that will overload the ACL
settings:
.TP
.I milterGreylistDelay 
The greylisting delay to use (time unit suffix allowed).
.TP
.I milterGreylistAutowhite
The autowhite delay to use (time unit suffix allowed).
.TP
.I milterGreylistFlushAddr
The value is ignored. If this key is present, then the IP address for
the sender machine will be flushed from greylist and autowhite databases.
.TP
.I milterGreylistCode
The SMTP code to return (e.g.: 551).
.TP
.I milterGreylistECode
The SMTP extended code to return (e.g.: 5.7.1)
.TP
.I milterGreylistMsg
The string to return with SMTP codes.
.TP
.I milterGreylistReport
The string to display in the
.I X-Greylist 
header.
.TP
.I milterGreylistIgnore
This line will be ignored, without warnings in the logs.
.TP
.I milterGreylistAction
This feature is nifty but use it with caution, as it makes the access
list a bit difficult to understand. By specifying the values
.I greylist\fR,
.I whitelist\fR,
or
.I blacklist\fR,
it is possible to overload the ACL action itself.
.PP
The ACL will match if any of the above key is returned: 
.I milterGreylistStatus
is not mandatory.
.PP
If you use an URL check in a DATA stage ACL, you can post the message header
and body to the URL. This is done by appending the
.I postmsg
keyword to the 
.I urlcheck 
statement, like in the example above:
.IP
  urlcheck "extfilter" "http://www.example.net/f.cgi" 5 postmsg

  dacl blacklist urlcheck "extfilter"
  dacl whitelist default
.PP
It is also possible to gather the properties returned by the URL and reuse
them in the ACL. This behavior is enabled by the
.I getprop
keyword at the end of 
.I urlcheck 
definition. If this option is enabled, the gathered properties can be 
accessed in the current and following ACL by prefixing them by a dollar ($).
If the 
.I clear
keyword is added, then properties will be cleaned up before handling a new
recipient. This avoids properties for several recipients to mix.
Finally, the
.I fork
keyword instructs 
.B milter-greylist(8)
to fork a separate instance of itself for performing the queries. Use it if 
you encounter thread-safety problems. 
.I fork
is not compatible with
.I postmsg\fR.
.PP
Here is an example that will use various DNSRBL depending on a per-recipient
setting stored in the 
.I dnsrbl
attribute of a LDAP directory.
.IP
  dnsrbl "RBL2" "rbl.example.net" "127.0.0.2"
  dnsrbl "RBL3" "rbl.example.net" "127.0.0.3"
  dnsrbl "RBL4" "rbl.example.net" "127.0.0.4"
  urlcheck "userconf" "ldap://localhost/dc=example,dc=net?milterGreylistStatus,dnsrbl?one?mail=%r" 5 getprop clear

.PP
Note that when matching gathered properties, format strings and regex can
be used.
.PP
.SH LDAP CHECKS
If milter-greylist was built with --with-openldap, then you can also use 
.I ldapcheck
for pulling information from an LDAP directory. This works exactly like
.I urlcheck\fR,
except that properties are always collected: the only available option is 
.I clear\fR.
.PP
A list of LDAP URL to use can be specified with the
.I ldapconf 
keyword:
.IP
  ldapconf "ldap://localhost ldaps://ldap.example.net"
.PP
If one of the server goes down, milter-greylist will try the next one.
When
.I ldaps://
is used, the system's 
.I ldap.conf
file is used to locate x509 certificates.
.PP
When defining LDAP queries with the
.I ldapcheck
statement, note that the scheme and host part of the URL are ignored.
Servers listed in
.I ldapconf
are used instead.
.PP
.SH CUSTOM REPORTS
The 
.I stat
keyword can be used to specify a custom report for milter-greylist activity.
It should be supplied with an output (either file or external command) and
a format string. Here is an example:
.IP
  stat ">>/var/log/milter-greylist.log" "%T{%T},%i,%f,%r,%A\\n"
.PP
If the output starts by 
.I >>
or
.I >
then it is a file. Use
.I >> 
to append to an existing file, and use
.I > 
to overwrite it. If the output starts by a 
.I |
then the output is a shell command, like in the example below:
.IP
  stat "|logger -p local7.info" "%T{%T},%i,%f,%r,%A\\n"
.PP
The format string gets substituted as URL checks format string: %r gets
substituted by the recipient, %f by the sender, and so on. See the 
.B FORMAT STRINGS
section for a complete list of available substitutions.
.SH COMMAND-LINE FLAG EQUIVALENTS
Most 
.B milter-greylist(8)
command-line options have equivalent options that can be set in the 
configuration file. Note that if a command line option is supplied,
it will always override the configuration file.
.PP
If a command-line equivalent keyword is used more than once, the last 
keyword will override the previous ones.
.TP
.I verbose
Enable debug output. This is equivalent to the
.B -v
flag.
.TP
.I quiet
Do not tell clients how much time remains before their e-mail will
be accepted. This is equivalent to the
.B -q
flag.
.TP
.I nodetach
Do not fork and go into the background. This is equivalent to the
.B -D
flag.
.TP
.I noauth
Greylist clients regardless if they succeeded SMTP AUTH or STARTTLS. 
Equivalent to the
.B -A
flag.
.TP
.I noaccessdb
Normally 
.B milter-greylist(8)
will whitelist a message if 
.B sendmail(8)
defines a ${greylist} macro set to WHITE. This enables complex whitelisting
rules based on the Sendmail access DB. This option inhibits this behavior.
.TP
.I nospf
Greylist clients regardless if they are SPF-compliant. Equivalent to the
.B -S
flag.
.TP
.I testmode
Enable test mode. Equivalent to the
.B -T
flag. This option is deprecated.
.TP
.I greylist
The argument sets how much time 
.B milter-greylist(8)
will want the client to wait between the first attempt and the time
the message is accepted. The time is given in seconds, except if a 
unit is given: m for minutes, h for hours, and d for days. 
The 
.I greylist 
keyword is equivalent to the
.B -w 
option. Here is an example that sets the delay to 45 minutes:
.IP
  greylist 45m
.TP
.I autowhite
This sets the auto-whitelisting duration, equivalent to the
.B -a
command-line option. As for the 
.I greylist
keyword,
units can be
supplied. Here is an example for a 3 day long auto-whitelisting:
.IP
  autowhite 3d
.TP
.I pidfile
This causes
.B milter-greylist(8)
to write its PID into the file given as argument, like the 
.B -P
command line argument does. The path to the file
must be absolute and it must be enclosed in quotes. Here is an example:
.IP
  pidfile "/var/run/greylist.pid"
.TP
.I dumpfile
This chooses the location of the greylist dump file, like the
.B -d
command line option does. The path must be absolute and enclosed in quotes.
It can optionally be followed by an octal permission mode.
Example:
.IP
  dumpfile "/var/milter-greylist/greylist.db" 640
.TP
.I subnetmatch
This is equivalent to the 
.B -L 
command line option. It takes a slash followed by a CIDR mask as argument,
and it commands the subnet matching feature. Example, for a class C wide
matching:
.IP
  subnetmatch /24
.TP
.I subnetmatch6
This is equivalent to the
.B -M
command line option. It takes a slash followed by a prefixlen as argument,
and it commands the subnet matching feature. Example, for a subnet wide
matching:
.IP
  subnetmatch6 /64
.TP
.I socket
Like the 
.B -p
command line option, this keyword is used to specify the socket used
to communicate with
.B sendmail(8)\fR.
It must be enclosed in quotes and can optionally be followed by an octal
permission mode
(valid values are 666, 660 or 600, other values cause an error):
.IP
  socket "/var/milter-greylist/milter-greylist.sock" 660
.TP
.I user
This keyword should be followed by a quoted user login and optionally a 
colon followed by a groupname.
Like the 
.B -u
option, this is used to run
.B milter-greylist(8)
as a non root user.  Here is an example:
.IP
  user "smmsp"
.SH MISCELLANEOUS
These options have no command line equivalent:
.TP
.I logfac
Sets the syslog facility for messages.  Can be set to any of the standard
facilities:
.I kern\fR,
.I user\fR,
.I mail\fR,
.I daemon\fR,
.I auth\fR,
.I syslog\fR,
.I lpr\fR,
.I news\fR,
.I uucp\fR,
.I cron\fR,
.I authpriv\fR,
.I ftp\fR,
.I local0\fR,
.I local1\fR,
.I local2\fR,
.I local3\fR,
.I local4\fR,
.I local5\fR,
.I local6\fR,
.I local7\fR.
Can also be set to
.I none
to disable syslog output completely.
.TP
.I timeout
is used to control how long greylist tuples are retained in the database. 
Value is in seconds, except if a suffix is given (m for minutes, h for hours,
d for days). Default is 5 days.
.TP
.I extendedregex
Use extended regular expressions instead of basic regular expressions.
.TP
.I maxpeek
Limit (in bytes) how much of messages are examined for header and body
searches.
.TP
.I lazyaw
Make auto-whitelist look at just the IP instead of the (sender IP,
sender e-mail address, recipient e-mail address) tuple.
.TP
.I domainexact
match on subdomain boundaries instead of the default suffix matching.
E.g. if
.I domainexact
is not enabled (the default) then gle.com will match google.com in 
addtion to gle.com. If 
.I domainexact
is enabled then, domain names will match on subdomain boundaries (e.g.  gle.com will
match mail.gle.com and gle.com but not google.com)
.TP
.I drac db
Tell where the DRAC DB file is. This is only available if DRAC support
was compiled in. Here is an example:
.IP
  drac db "/usr/local/etc/drac.db"
.TP
.I nodrac
Disable DRAC.
.TP
.I logexpired
This option causes greylist entries that expire to be logged via syslog.
This allows you to easily collect the IP addresses and sender names and
use them for blacklisting, SPAM scoring, etc.  Normally, expirations are
only logged if the
.B debug
option is set, but that generates a lot of extra messages.
.PP
The configuration file is reloaded automatically once it is modified when
new e-mail arrives. Most configuration keywords will take effect
immediately, except the following, which will only take effect after 
a restart of 
.B milter-greylist(8)\fR: 
.I nodetach\fR,
.I pidfile\fR,
.I socket\fR,
and 
.I user\fR.
.PP
The 
.I dumpfreq
option can be changed dynamically, but the change will only take effect 
after the next dump.
.SH FORMAT STRINGS
Various statements in the configuration file accept format strings, where
the following % prefixed tokens are substituted. Here is the complete list
of available substitutions (Note that some substitutions are not relevant
in any context).
.TP
.I %r
